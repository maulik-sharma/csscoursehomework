        <p>Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world and one of the most iconic and endangered species on the planet.
            Known for their distinctive orange coat with black stripes, tigers are powerful, stealthy predators native to parts of Asia.

        </p>
        <p>Tigers are solitary animals and primarily hunt at night.
            They play a critical role in maintaining the health of ecosystems by controlling prey populations.
            Sadly, tiger populations have declined dramatically over the past century due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.
