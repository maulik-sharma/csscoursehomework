            Tiger conservation is a critical global effort aimed at protecting one of the world's
            most iconic and endangered species. Over the last century, tiger populations have
            plummeted by over 95% due to habitat destruction, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.
            With fewer than 4,000 tigers left in the wild, urgent action is needed to prevent their extinction.
        </p>

        <p>
            Conservation programs around the world focus on preserving natural habitats, enforcing
            anti-poaching laws, and supporting local communities living near tiger territories.
            Protected areas like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries play a vital role in
            providing safe environments for tigers to live and breed. Initiatives such as India's
            Project Tiger and the Global Tiger Recovery Program are examples of coordinated
            international efforts to restore tiger populations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Technology has also become a powerful ally in conservation. Tools like camera traps,
            drones, and satellite tracking help monitor tiger movements and detect illegal
            activities in remote regions. Additionally, awareness campaigns and education
            programs aim to reduce demand for tiger parts and promote coexistence between humans and wildlife.
        </p>

        <p>
            Saving tigers is not just about protecting a single species—it’s about preserving entire
            ecosystems. As apex predators, tigers play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of
            their habitats. By conserving tigers, we help safeguard biodiversity and ensure the health
            of our planet for future generations.
        </p>
